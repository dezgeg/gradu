    Abstract = {This dissertation presents a new technique for disk storage management called a log-structured file system. The technique writes all file system changes in large sequential transfers to a log-like structure on disk. The key benefit is a high write performance that is independent of the workload. The large transfers also enable the efficient use of large disk arrays such as RAIDs. The technique minimizes the overhead of computing the redundancy information required by large RAIDs.   <p>A log-structured file system achieves high write rates without sacrificing file retrieval performance. Files are read back from the log efficiently due to the indexing information that is maintained. The log structure also permits fast recovery from system crashes. Using a recovery system based on checkpoints and roll-forward the log-structured file system can quickly restore the disk to a consistent state.   <p>An important focus of this dissertation is the technique used for free space management in a log--structured file system. The approach taken was to divide the disk into large segments to which the log was written. A segment cleaner mechanism exists to compress the live information from heavily fragmented segments. The mechanism reads in the fragmented segments, compacts the live data, and writes the data back to segments on disk. The dissertation includes a series of simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of a simple segment cleaning policy based on cost and benefit. The segment cleaner decides which segments to clean based on a function of the fraction alive in the segment and the age of the data in the segment.   <p>I have implemented a prototype log-structured file system called Sprite LFS; it outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of magnitude for small-file writes and matches or exceeds Unix performance for reads and large writes. Even when the overhead for cleaning is included, Sprite LFS can use 70% of the disk bandwidth for writing. Unix file systems typically can use only 5-10%.}

% Description of Ext2 journaling
% - Long recovery time of non-journalled fs.
% - Mentions internal invariants & caching
%    - "The layout of data on disk (or alternatively, perhaps, its network protocol, if the filesystem is not local), details of internal caching,
        and the algorithms used to schedule disk IO - these are all things which can be changed without necessarily violating the specification of
        the filesystem's application interface."
% - Mentions Fast Filesystem as a synchronous Unix filesystem variant
% - Mentions recovery constructs such as preserving (ext2 has), predictability & atomicity (which ext2 doesn't)
% - Easy to extend existing ext2
% - Simply record metadata blocks to journal, wrap around when needed
% - Only once journal safely committed, writing to actual blocks can start
% - Concept of transaction and some ordering dependencies
%   - Relative to database transactions, short-lived & never need to abort

abstract="Today we see an increasing demand for flash memory because it has certain advantages like resistance against kinetic shock. However, reliable data storage also requires a specialized file system knowing and handling the limitations of flash memory. This paper develops a formal, abstract model for the UBIFS flash file system, which has recently been included in the Linux kernel. We develop formal specifications for the core components of the file system: the inode-based file store, the flash index, its cached copy in the RAM and the journal to save the differences. Based on these data structures we give an abstract specification of the interface operations of UBIFS and prove some of the most important properties using the interactive verification system KIV.",
