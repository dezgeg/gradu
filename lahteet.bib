% Description of Ext2 journaling
% - Long recovery time of non-journalled fs.
% - Mentions internal invariants & caching
%    - "The layout of data on disk (or alternatively, perhaps, its network protocol, if the filesystem is not local), details of internal caching,
        and the algorithms used to schedule disk IO - these are all things which can be changed without necessarily violating the specification of
        the filesystem's application interface."
% - Mentions Fast Filesystem as a synchronous Unix filesystem variant
% - Mentions recovery constructs such as preserving (ext2 has), predictability & atomicity (which ext2 doesn't)
% - Easy to extend existing ext2
% - Simply record metadata blocks to journal, wrap around when needed
% - Only once journal safely committed, writing to actual blocks can start
% - Concept of transaction and some ordering dependencies
%   - Relative to database transactions, short-lived & never need to abort
